# L7 Software presents: BarCode!

## What is this application?
BarCode is a cocktail database

## What will it do?
BarCode will be a searchable drinks database. Users will be able to enter in what ingredients they have on hand and find out drink that they can make based on that. Users will be able to rate ingredients and have drink recommendations weighted on their preferences. Users will be able to put together menus of favorite drinks, and share these recipes and menus with friends.

## What technologies will BarCode use?
For the app, BarCode is using React with Redux for a framework. Styling is happening using Bootstrap and flexbox.

On the server side, Node and Express comprise the server. Mongo/Mongoose comprise the database layer. Mocha and Chai are being used for testing.
